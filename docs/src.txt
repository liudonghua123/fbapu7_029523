Editing the src of FB Alpha Plus!

Well this is a short readme, but maybe it will be helpfull, this is intended to show
how to modify this src.

First of all you need to be somewhat familiar with C/C++, because this emulator is
coded with those languages, then you need a text editor such as Notepad, WordPad, MetaPad,
etc...
Anyway I personally recomend 2 editors, that are very stable and have extra features, like
Ultra-Edit 32 or Dev C++, they can be found on http://www.google.com (you must look for
them), they have sintax highlighting, text autoindent and a lot of extra features that
make src editting easier.

Then the final, I recomend to make a backup before editing the src, so if you do something
wrong you can restore your old files.
